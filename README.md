# Live.Love.Travel.
Code Institute -  User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

Welcome to my travel website where I showcase destinations from around the world along with some exciting and engaging stories from other explorers. 
On the site four places are highlighted and I share information on topics such as food, transport, accommodation, culture, climate and safety for each location.

## UX

### User stories

**External userâ€™s goal:** 

Travel enthusiasts and explorers


As a travel fan and adventure seeker I want to learn more about travelling to cool and exciting travel destinations. 

As a female explorer I want to learn about someone elses travel story and share my own. 


**Site owner's goals:**

As a site owner I want to share my experience with people and hear about other travel adventures from peoples 

As a social person I want to connect with new people and share knowledge


### Strategy
My goal for this website was to make it clear and simple. Make information easy to access on all four destinations and all users to connect with me. 

### Scope
I wanted visitors to the site to know straight away what it was about and what informtion they could find there. 

### Structure
I wanted the structure to be very simple to enable users to make the minimum number of clicks to access the desired infomation.

### Surface
I chose a muted colour palette to ensure the images would take focus and not distract two much. I chose one accent colour for cards and buttons to empahise that content.

## Features

### Existing Features
This site currently contains the following features: 
- Showcases photos and information on a number of the travel destinations to motivate people to visit. 
- By clicking on each destination image from the homepages the user can learn more about that place. 
- Provides detail about the site owner.

### Features Left to Implement

In the future I would like the featured travel story to by populated dynamicaly from the collection of stories submitted via the website. 


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. 
Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure 
that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and 
straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.


My user stories 



**Responsiiveness TO BE COMPLETED**


In addition, you should mention in this section how your project
looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 4, 5, 7: Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. During the testing phase, I realized that ```background-attachment: fixed``` was not compatible with iOS browsers. On Chrome and Safari in iOS, the background photos appeared zoomed-in and blurry. To fix this, the ```background-attachment: scroll``` property value was added in a media query.





**Contact Form**
There are two conact forms on the site one on the About Me page and one on the Travel Story Page.
If a site visitor is interested in contacting me or sharing a story they can fill out these forms by following the steps below: 


1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "About Me" page
    2. Click the "Ask Me a Question" button
    3. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields(name and email) appears
    4. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    5. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

2. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Travel Stories" page
    2. Click the "Share your story today" or "Share your story" button
    3. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields(name and email) appears

    5. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.



**External Links**

All external links on the travel stories page open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"'. 

**Page Links**
 
All links have been manually tested to ensure that none of them are broken and they point to the correct destination.


**Page Links**

All images have an assigned "alt" test attributed to them. 


**Bugs or Problems To BE COMPLETED  ???**

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems 
you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
