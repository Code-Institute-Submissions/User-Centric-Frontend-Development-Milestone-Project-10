# Live.Love.Travel.
Code Institute -  User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

Welcome to my travel website where I showcase destinations from around the world along with some exciting and engaging stories from other explorers. 
On the site four places are highlighted and I share information on topics such as food, transport, accommodation, culture, climate and safety for each location.
