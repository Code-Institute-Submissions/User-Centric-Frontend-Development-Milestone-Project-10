# Live.Love.Travel.
Code Institute -  User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

Welcome to my travel website where I showcase destinations from around the world along with some exciting and engaging stories from other explorers. 
On the site four places are highlighted and I share information on topics such as food, transport, accommodation, culture, climate and safety for each location.

## UX

### User stories

**External userâ€™s goal:** 

Travel enthusiasts and explorers


As a travel fan and adventure seeker I want to learn more about travelling to cool and exciting travel destinations. 

As a female explorer I want to learn about someone elses travel story and share my own. 


**Site owner's goals:**

As a site owner I want to share my experience with people and hear about other travel adventures from peoples 

As a social person I want to connect with new people and share knowledge


### Strategy
My goal for this website was to make it clear and simple. Make information easy to access on all four destinations and all users to connect with me. 

### Scope
I wanted visitors to the site to know straight away what it was about and what informtion they could find there. 

### Structure
I wanted the structure to be very simple to enable users to make the minimum number of clicks to access the desired infomation.

### Surface
I chose a muted colour palette to ensure the images would take focus and not distract two much. I chose one accent colour for cards and buttons to empahise that content.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
Features to be included
Showcase photos and information on a number of the travel destinations to motivate people to visit. 
Provide detail about the site owner
Provide an options for people to submit stories to be featured on the site
Provide links to external resources, such as the band's social media profiles (can point anywhere at all)


### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
